# OCAD U STUDENT PRESS WEBSITE

#### TODO

- [ ] Add fonts as files to the project and reference them in the css
- [ ] Figure out how to get stuff from Are.na

#### Questions to consider

- Right now the design is so you can go from left to right and see the publications, How can you promote discovery and engagement in this website?

###### Notes from @caizoryan

- I added the are.na wrapper file and linked it. There's an example how to get a channel and it's content or how to get a block and its content.
- We are going to make a layout tool kind of thing that makes websites from are.na blocks, maybe you can have that here embeded on the website as well. I'll explain what I mean later
- I also added a jquery link so its easy for you to work with javascript and html
