        The OCAD U Student Press
        <img class="spin-on-hover" src="pictures/small-star.png" /> serves as a
        platform for idea sharing, research, and communication among the OCAD U
        student and faculty community. Over the recent years, the student press
        has been lost in the void, but is back, under new leadership with the
        same ethos, to honor the community an the press before it.
